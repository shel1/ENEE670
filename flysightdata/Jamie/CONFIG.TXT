; Alarm settings

; WARNING: GPS measurements depend on very weak signals
;          received from orbiting satellites. As such, they
;          are prone to interference, and should NEVER be
;          relied upon for life saving purposes.

;          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THESE ALARMS BE
;          USED TO INDICATE DEPLOYMENT OR BREAKOFF ALTITUDE.

; NOTE:    Alarm elevations are given in meters above ground
;          elevation, which is specified in DZ_Elev.

Window:        0 ; Alarm window (m)
DZ_Elev:       0 ; Ground elevation (m above sea level)

Alarm_Elev:    0 ; Alarm elevation (m above ground level)
Alarm_Type:    0 ; Alarm type
                 ;   0 = No alarm
                 ;   1 = Beep
