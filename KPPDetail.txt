 # Risk/Opportunity Management plan
-     Access the risks involved with the KPPs
-     Identify the levels of risk for each KPP 
-     Identify opportunities that may arise as a result
-     Identify consequences
-     risk/opportunity table
-     determine certainties and uncertainties in the KPPs to simulate
-     Determine a mitigation plan



Objective Systems Overview:
-	tracking system to track skydivers during a jump 
-	situational awareness of skydivers for aircrafts, other divers, and ground station
-	track time in air, altitude, velocity of decent using sensors 
-	uses ABD-S to alert other planes in area of divers’ locations
-	10 mi radius of ground station
-	will be activated right before take off from ground 
-	uses transmitters attached to jumper to send signals of info tracking down to ground station customized receiver 
-	display at ground station of jumpers’ tracking information and stores in database
-	transmitter has unique coding for each person, similar to air traffic control coding for planes in area
-	ground station will send handshake to jumpers’ transmitter 
-	transmitters attached to jumper will also send same signals of info tracking to aircraft in vicinity (need requirement)
      - will also send info to surrounding jumpers for proximity awareness 
      - if too close, audible notification will engage 
-   Stating the KPPs and requirements that we need
