Objective Systems Overview:
-	tracking system to track skydivers during a jump 
-	situational awareness of skydivers for aircrafts, other divers, and ground station
-	track time in air, altitude, velocity of decent using sensors 
-	uses ABD-S to alert other planes in area of divers’ locations
-	10 mi radius of ground station
-	will be activated right before take off from ground 
-	uses transmitters attached to jumper to send signals of info tracking down to ground station customized receiver 
-	display at ground station of jumpers’ tracking information and stores in database
-	transmitter has unique coding for each person, similar to air traffic control coding for planes in area
-	ground station will send handshake to jumpers’ transmitter 
-	transmitters attached to jumper will also send same signals of info tracking to aircraft in vicinity (need requirement)
      - will also send info to surrounding jumpers for proximity awareness
